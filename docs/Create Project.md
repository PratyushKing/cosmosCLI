# Create Project

In a typical use case scenario, you would use the dotnet new command to create a new project with specifying template and all, but with CosmosCLI, it's far more simplified, all you have to do is:
## `cosmos -c <project_name>`

Now there are 2 benefits of this,
- It's much convenient to do it this way.
- It generates an cosmos build file for you, that can be used with running and building.

You have to install the cosmos templates for these to work though. So if you just installed the CLI, please check the [Post Install of cosmos](../README.md#post-install).

If you want to know what all stuff you can do with the build/project file, check the [CPF Docs](CPF%20Docs.md)!
