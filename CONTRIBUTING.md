# CosmosCLI Contributing Policies:

- Please don't be a dumbass, use pull requests sensibly
- Please note that you should not cause merge conflicts.
- Pretty please read this one, DO NOT EDIT THE WHOLE DAMN PROJECT and categorize commits so it's easier to review.
- Final one, please make sure that you are using the same dotnet version as the currnet project and make sure that you throughly test your pull request before putting it up.
